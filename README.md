Example of a computer vision image multiclassification with pre-trained ResNet50 model from Keras and NN weights from ImageNet.

Two pictures of a friendÂ´s dogs and a randomly chosen image of an elephant were classfied correctly:

highest probabilities: dog 1 = 88.90% - Shetland_sheepdog,
                       dog 2= 70.14% - beagle,
                       elephant = 54.29% - african elephant
